# Debug Bus Interface(s)

This depository consists of a series of debugging bus interfaces.

Each interface connects an external debug port, whether UART, SPI, JTAG, or
RPI Parallel port, to the master port of a wishbone
bus.  Hence, the debug interface allows you access to any device located on
the wishbone bus--both to read from and write to that bus.

It is my intention to use the various components of each of the busses as
teaching tools on the [ZipCPU blog](http://zipcpu.com)
